                <h2>Please see changes introduced for this release below</h2>
                <h2 style="color:dodgerblue"> Staff Member admin toggle capabilities and a brand new Settings page</h2>
                <hr>
                <h2> Add a new Settings Menu to clean up in the in-app admin panel </h2>
                
                <p> Added a new 'Settings' menu that will now act as a landing page to access common school admin features. We'll also be adding a number of new pages over the coming month and the Settings page will consolidate all of these options into a single page that is easy to access. As a result, you'll notice the side bar is now more compact and the following pages will have a new home:
                
                <ul>
                <li> Subjects </li>
                <li> Timetable Subjects </li>
                <li> Manage Class Years </l1>
                <li> Marking Schemes </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Please note: The availability of the above options will be dependent on the features enabled for the school i.e. a school with Timetables switched off will not be able to see the 'Timetables Subjects' option etc </p>
                
                <p> To access the new settings menu, click 'Admin' and then head to 'Settings'. We have preserved a redirect from the old structure so if a user has bookmarked an admin page in the old structure before this change, they'll now be automatically redirected to the new pages in this current structure. <p>
                
                
                <h2> Add Staff Administrator toggle to Staff Members table </h2>
                
                <p>We've added a new admin toggle to the Staff Members tab in order to allow school admins to easily adjust admin privileges for selected staff members without requiring support intervention. Admin privileges are applied instantly once toggled. </p>
                
                <h2>The Admin toggle on manage users should be disabled for users without emails </h2>
                
                <p> The toggle will now be disabled for staff members that do not have an email addressed assigned in their profile. Once an email is added, the toggle will be enabled so that admins can change admin status. Upon hovering over a disabled toggle, a tooltip will be shown to users to indicate this. </p>
